# TextBasedAdventureGame

This python program allows the user to navigate through the game, where they will discover doors. This is one of the first
python projects that I have worked on and I am definitely planning to exapnd it even further by adding items that the user can 
collect while navigating through the game. (Maybe keys where user need to collect to unlock doors. 

In this game, the user will be asked to input the direction and the number of steps to take. The user will then be told of the
location, he/she is in. There will be walls and doors. The game layout is created based on x and y axis, and the position of 
the rooms, walls and hallway in the game is classified into lists according to their location with respect to the x and y axis.

The user will be updated of the location they are in each time they input the location and the number of steps to take. 


At this first stage of the game, the user will be required to navigate all the 6 doors in the game under a certain amount of
time.
